# Human Centered Reflective Portfolio
## Week 1:
## Week 2:
This week topics covered the wisdom of crowd. I liked that in the lecture we had an activity to do, it was engaging and made the lecture more fun and comprehensive. Also talking about the theory of Condorcet jury theorem and diversity prediction theorem, I like the fact that there is a clear application of these models – juries and how this model has been integrating in society. I think it is very interesting how there are set parameters of being, diverse, bringing new knowledge, independence and aggregation in order for this to work.
This model also reminded me of how science advances. When scientists discover things, it involves more than one person, from the idea to experimentation to make sure that the discovery that is being made is valid and accurate.
Also within this lecture, the idea of many-model thinking has been introduced. The closest thing I could use to understand how models are being simplified is of how we study and understand or process things. For example how to study one will make a model of the concepts and the relationships and links from one concept to another – like in a textbook to condense it and I guess the textbook it one big model and when you learn and study from it you are making smaller models that help in understanding the overall concept of the subject of the course.
Also, to mention concepts that were a bit fuzzy at first were resilience of a system and emergent behaviour. These were new concepts, but I have understood that the resilience is the degree to which systems can recover from a disruptive event and that emergent behaviour is unpredictable and depends on the relationship of each part with another. I think it will be interesting to see how these will be modelled.
Other important notes in this week are:
-	I tried creating a GitHub repository but I ended up elsewhere. I am trying again.
-	Also made a group for the assignment in the canvas group tab.

## Week 3:
The topic of this week’s lecture was around modelling how people behave. When I first looked at this, I thought it was interesting to see that when events such as conflicts amongst people arise,  how that would be predicted by models? 
I like the categorisation of these models into rational, behavioural and rule based. It quite is straightforward and easy to understand. 
Going through the lecture and readings on Canvas, I thought of customer relationship management type systems and how AI can track how people spend and try to sell them things accordingly. We see the application of this from major companies like Google, YouTube, Facebook and how they interact with their customers.
When learning about Shapley value, at first I didn’t really grasp it, but I thought it was fascinating how behaviour is turned into a mathematical model. Also, the lecture slides really helped and by doing problems around Shapley value really helped me in understanding it.
I think signalling is incredibly interesting of how sending a costly signal will give either really good or really bad results and that costliness carries meaning. I think of business and how people can use that knowledge in real world areas in order to portray a certain image. Also I think it’s also remarkable that people naturally, intentionally or  not already experience signalling both sending out signals but also receiving them. I think it is a really interesting way in how people interact.

## Week 4:
In this week’s lecture, we had a first group activity. It was quiet at first and I hadn’t used whiteboards before and that we couldn’t screenshare presented to be a hard transition. It was a challenge to express ideas purely verbally. However, then using google docs was very helpful and it helped in communication and collaboration amongst peers. Once we kind of figured this out it worked out pretty well. 
For the SIR model I understood the relationships and links between all of them, but not quite the math. Also, everyone in the group had different ideas of looking at it and so it was confusing putting all of them together. But at the end everything came together which was good and seeing mathematical representation was also interesting.

I think that this idea of the SIR model is good for the project as it is based around covid-19 and so the idea of susceptible, infected and recovered will apply to the project.

In addition to this concept, networks are really interesting because they are so complex and extensive, and that this model applies to everyone. Within the lecture this  and ABM models and agents was also discussed.  

I think that this lecture and concepts covered in general will be useful for our report.
Also one of the teachers, talked about the https://thesystemsthinker.com/. Looking a website it has a lot of information and I think will be a useful resource for the assignment.

## Week 5:
A lot of the probability and statistic concepts covered was very similar to math advanced in high school. However. applying that to modelling and linking the two was really insightful to see the relationship between the theory and actual application.
Also, I think that using these concepts can be useful for extrapolating data and predicting certain trends. 
Additionally, throughout the group task within the lecture, I think because last week we were introduced to the breakout rooms, I got the sense that everyone was a bit more comfortable. We worked well as a group. Although I do not have a screenshot of our diagram about the book and library UML Class diagram, I remember working through it and that our group presented it in class. It was noteworthy that we defined our parameters of the library and the people in it was slightly different from other groups and elaborated on the system differently. 

## Week 6:
It was a lot of new models to learn at once. It took a while to understand from the readings, but the lecture really helped clarify the ideas.
The first model that was discussed in the lecture was the Markov model. It talked about that future states depend only on the current state, not on the events that occurred before it. It also naturally equates to an equilibrium through the convergence theorem. It is very interesting to see how naturally things follow a mathematical trend and that human made systems like innovation within a company is the intervention needed for longevity and being up to date in society.
The second concept was random walks, it describes a path that consists of a succession of random events doesn’t guarantee a higher or lower chance of an event occurring and that for an event to occur it doesn’t depend on past performance. As in the readings mentioned – this occurs in the stock market.
The next models talk about the growth of ideas/ information within groups of people: 
-	Broadcast – spreading of information from a centralised source. It is also interesting how this can also be translated into quantitative data (the diffusion curve).
-	Diffusion – spreading of information or ideas within a population – this again also has quantitative data however the curve/ graph is quite different. I didn’t expect it to be. 
-	Bass model – broadcast + diffusion – describes the process of how new ideas get adopted in a population – can be used for marketing as well
-	Contagion – disease/idea spreading within a population + recovery, this could also be useful for our assignment
It was interesting how all of these models, model the same thing but differently. I particularly enjoyed being able to contrast between all of them and seeing their slight differences.
In addition to this, there was also group activity in the lecture. Below is a screenshot of the document that we made to answer the questions.

## Week 7:
The first model is the segregation model, talking about  how people move to different physical areas in accordance to the similar interests of them with accordance to their surroundings. I really liked seeing the interactive simulation of the segregation model through the readings.  
The information about the riots from Granovetter’s riot model were interesting as this also relates to last week’s sub-topic about information and things spreading amongst community. It is also interesting to see threshold of people and how it starts that if no-one has a threshold of 0 then nothing would start. 
The culture model is quite interesting because it defines people by their behaviours. And that similar behaviours construct one culture and other behaviours another. I think it is also interesting to see how cultures change over time yet, things like tradition stay constant despite time and evolution.
There was also another group activity in the lecture, finishing off last week’s activity but it was quite brief.

## Week 8:
I really enjoyed the content of this week, although it was a bit confusing at first. 
1.	The prisoner’s dilemma. I thought that was very interesting and that in the iterative game, the winning strategy is cooperation and tit for tat. I remember a while back listening to a lecture about how neurons work and behavioural evolution. It’s a topic that has interested me a bit. I think it is really interesting how this strategy is stemmed from evolution and that these strategies are very much hard-wired in humans. I think it is interesting however to be able to observe it from an objective point and describe it mathematically and in terms of it being a theory. Also, I thought that the topic that Zoey was talking about of how people have come up with the idea of how to make it so that it is most beneficial for the one person, was also interesting and that there are many ways in analysing and looking at this theory.

## Week 9:
Teacher and group consultation – the two of the members couldn’t attend but we told them what we had talked about. This consultation really clarified the coding and noncoding option. We were also thinking that we would have to create python from scratch but now talking with the teacher clarified the instructions for the assignment. We also received feedback from our draft submissions and talking about our models, did steer us in the right direction for our projects.

## Week 10:
There was a consultation however we did not attend instead we were working on our assignments and had a group meeting to catch up with each other and see where everyone was up to in the project.

## Week 11:
Again we didn’t have any questions to ask so just continued working on our projects.

## Week 12:
Had a recap of the subject. It was good seeing how everything we have learnt linking together and seeing how everything fits in together. 
Also just finishing up our assignment to submit and finishing this reflective portfolio to submit.
